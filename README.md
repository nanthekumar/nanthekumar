Hi, I’m a CX and MarTech leader with 17 years’ experience delivering digital transformation, intelligent customer journeys and automation across financial services, real estate, government and digital-first brands.

I specialise in AI agentic systems, CDP architectures and end-to-end lifecycle design that improve acquisition, engagement and LTV. My work integrates product, data, marketing and technology to modernise MarTech ecosystems and scale multi-market CX operations across APAC.

My background spans enterprise organisations (Citibank, NTUC, PropertyGuru), agency environments (Wunderman), startups, and hands-on AI engineering through my consultancy, FullStack CXO. This includes building real AI applications and automation engines to help teams accelerate operation, personalisation and growth.

Over the years, I’ve also invested deeply in professional development — including certified Regression Therapy (TASSO), clinical Hypnotherapy training (EKAA) and advanced mind–body disciplines — strengthening my ability to lead with clarity, presence and emotional intelligence.

Today, I help businesses design AI-powered customer journey engines, modernise their MarTech foundations and build high-performing digital and CX teams.
